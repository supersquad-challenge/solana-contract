## Supersquad

Tournament Pool based Gamification system
SuperSquad stands out by combining the concept of habit-building with a money pool challenge. You can put your money on a challenge pool and prove that they have completed your daily routine. If you are successful, not only save you principal but also earn extra yield from Defi protocols. Additionally, SuperSquad offers ranking-based tournament pools where winners can earn even greater rewards. This gamification system effectively motivates participants to stick to their routines and achieve their goals.
